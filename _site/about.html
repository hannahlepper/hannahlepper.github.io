<p>Title: Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance in Sewage.</p>

<p>Brief synopsis: I aimed to shed light on the distribution and drivers of antimicrobial resistance genes in sewage samples using statistical and mathematical models, and metagenomic data from sewage samples. Techniques included a systematic review, a compartmental ODE transmission model, and multi-level multi-response linear regression models. A key finding from my research is that the relationship between resistance in hospitals and in community sewage varies according to the type of antimicrobial resistance studies, perhaps due to differences in transmission dynamics, and that upstream samples are essential to disentangling the combination of resistomes found in waste water samples.</p>
